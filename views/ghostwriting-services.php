										<h2 class="title">What Do I Need to Consider When Choosing a Ghostwriter?</h2>
									</div>
									<div class="icon"></div>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it
											nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and
											trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting
											companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all your writing and
											editing needs:</p>
										<ol>
											<li><b>Is the price right?</b> If it seems too good to be true, it probably
												is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work
												and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate
												writers who market “affordable” prices.</li>
											<li><b>Who owns the rights to the book?</b> It’s your book, which means you
												should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking
												for partial rights to your material.</li>
											<li><b>What is the payment arrangement?</b> You should always pay for
												ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the
												initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re
												happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should
												have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your
												writer know what to expect.</li>
											<li><b>Who’s in charge?</b> Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative
												effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a
												writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it will
												not be your book—it will be theirs.</li>
											<li><b>Should I choose a freelancer or a firm?</b> Beware of working with
												freelancers. While some may be reputable or qualified, most are
												overbooked and will not make good on the promises they make to you.
												Also, if anything should go wrong (whether it’s an issue between you and
												the writer, or a health concern), you will be stuck in the awkward and
												frustrating position of reclaiming your expenditures and then finding a
												replacement writer. With a firm like ours, we replace the writer free of
												charge to ensure the process moves forward efficiently and effectively.
											</li>
											<li><b>What&#8217;s their reputation?</b> Be sure the writer or firm has
												worked on books that have been published by major publishing houses.
												Ideally, the writing service you choose will have a robust staff of
												bestselling writers, experienced editors, and a wide range of
												connections to literary agents and publishers.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain
											that you are working with a reputable and experienced company.</p>

										<p>The duration of the ghostwriting process is partly up to you. Depending on

								</div>
								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>Absolutely! The most important elements in writing a book are the ideas—and
											as the author and initiator of your book, the ideas are all yours. Even if
											you don’t consider yourself a writer or are too busy to develop a
											publishable book, your voice still deserves to be heard. The ghostwriting
											process is simply a means to get your wisdom, methods, story, or ideas onto
											paper.</p>
