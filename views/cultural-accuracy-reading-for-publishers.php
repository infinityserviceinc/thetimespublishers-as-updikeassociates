														<h2 style="text-align: center;">Why is Cultural Accuracy Reading Important?</h2>
<hr />
<div class='content-column one_half'><p>Readers, librarians, and retailers are holding publishers accountable for misrepresentation more than ever. For far too long, the vast majority of publishing employees have been white, middle-class, cisgender, and heterosexual, and these have been the experiences most frequently represented in the books they publish.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of cultural competence, publishers have unintentionally released problematic and insensitive books. Publishers must ensure that their books are affirming, authentic, and accurate as they respond to calls for social justice with more diverse lists.</p></div>
<div class='content-column one_half last_column'><p>No customer should be harmed as a result of reading material for entertainment or education. No librarian or retailer should have to be concerned that a book they're selling contributes to the spread of harmful or inaccurate ideas about already marginalized groups. No author should lose sales, face public shaming, or have their book "canceled" because of minor issues.</p>
<p>We've created a cultural accuracy reading service to make it as simple as possible for publishers to ensure that their entire list is reviewed for issues of representation and that harmful content is identified before it's published.</p></div><div class='clear_column'></div>

															<p>It was an absolute pleasure getting to work with Updike and our team. We reached out to them for an authenticity read and the reader we were paired with was thorough, highly attentive, and had an excellent grasp of the subject matter at hand. Weâ€™re extremely grateful to the KAA team for their professionalism and resourcefulness, and highly recommend their services.</p>

															<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so happy that I moved forward with a Cultural Accuracy Reading at KAA, so my book could be more inclusive and resonate with a wide range of readers. They spent time making sure they found the best reader who could address my concerns and personal blindspots. My reader shared clear comments and provided great alternative words and phrases to explore using instead. I also loved the helpful resources and links to articles to provide me with more context and education. I not only have a better book because of a CAR, but I also feel like a better human. I have been recommending this service to my friends and clients because I truly believe all authors should have a Cultural Accuracy Reading before sharing their work with the world.&#8221;</p>

																																				<div class="entry-content">
													<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Cultural accuracy reading involves vetting a manuscript for<strong> issues of (mis)representation</strong>, <strong>biases</strong>, and a range of <strong>other factors</strong> that may offend or be deemed harmful to a person or population.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our service provides targeted reads from professional, experienced, and carefully vetted editors who specialize in recognizing potential cultural accuracy or authenticity issues. And their diversity enables us to match the right editor with the specific concerns publishers want addressed in a manuscript.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our firm and Board of Standards reviews and manages the process so publishers have a single point of contact to deal with and can be assured that quality is high, costs are controlled, and deadlines are met.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The process is simple, similar to the legal vetting publishers give the majority of their books:</strong></h4>
