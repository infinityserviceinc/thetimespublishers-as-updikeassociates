										<p>Since you’re the expert, you’re probably busy doing what you do best! And

											writing or publishing a book. Our ghostwriting services allow you to focus
											on your business while we dedicate the time, expertise, and energy necessary

										<p>Your level of involvement is entirely up to you, though we do recommend at

											your book, which means that you have final say on the content; how and when
											you give your input and approval is your decision. We’ll work with you to

										<p>The duration of the ghostwriting process is partly up to you. Depending on

											rush these services for you if you need to meet a specific publishing

										<p class="title">What Do I Need to Consider When Choosing a Book Ghostwriter?
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="icon"></div>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it
											nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and
											trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting
											companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all your writing and
											editing needs:</p>
										<ol>
											<li><b>Is the price right?</b> If it seems too good to be true, it probably
												is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work
												and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate
												writers who market “affordable” or heavily discounted prices.</li>
											<li><b>Who owns the rights to the book?</b> It’s your book, which means you
												should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking
												for partial rights to your material.</li>
											<li><b>What is the payment arrangement?</b> You should always pay for
												ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the
												initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re
												happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should
												have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your
												writer know what to expect.</li>
											<li><b>Who’s in charge?</b> Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative
												effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a
												writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it will
												not be your book—it will be theirs.</li>
											<li><b>Should I choose a freelancer or a firm?</b> Beware of working with
												freelancers. While some may be reputable or qualified, most are
												overbooked and will not make good on the promises they make to you.
												Also, if anything should go wrong (whether it’s an issue between you and
												the writer, or an unforeseen health concern), you will be stuck in the
												awkward and frustrating position of reclaiming your expenditures and
												then finding a replacement writer. With a firm like ours, we replace the
												writer free of charge to ensure the process moves forward efficiently
												and effectively.</li>
											<li><b>What&#8217;s their reputation?</b> Be sure the writer or firm has
												worked on books that have been published by major publishing houses.
												Ideally, the writing service you choose will have a robust staff of
												bestselling writers, experienced editors with publishing experience, and
												deep connections to literary agents and publishers. You should be able
												to look at a writer&#8217;s client list and see names you recognize.
												There should be some <em>New York Times</em>, <em>USA Today</em>, or
												<em>Wall Street Journal</em> bestsellers on their list (beware of
												&#8220;Amazon&#8221; bestsellers, which are easy for anyone to rig). And
												don&#8217;t fall for this line: &#8220;Since I&#8217;m a ghostwriter, I
												can&#8217;t share any titles due to confidentiality.&#8221; While most
												ghostwriting relationships with clients may be confidential, any
												experienced writer will have some industry credits and secured
												acknowledgements. If a ghostwriter can&#8217;t share any of their
												clients or work, then they probably don&#8217;t have much to show.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain
											that you are working with a reputable and experienced company.</p>
