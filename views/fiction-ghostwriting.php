														</div>
														<div class="icon"></div>
													</div>
													<div class="body-content body">
														<div class="entry-content">
															<p>The Internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all your writing and editing needs:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Is the price right? </b>If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.</li>
<li><b>Who owns the rights to the book? </b>It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.</li>
<li><b>What is the payment arrangement?</b> You should always pay for ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your writer know what to expect.</li>
<li><b>Who’s in charge? </b>Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.</li>
<li><b>Is the service confidential? </b>This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed manuscript unless you want it to be there.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that you are working with a reputable company with experience.</p>

														<div class="entry-content">
															<p>Absolutely! Your ghostwriter can be intimately involved with the planning and development of your concept, and they can also perform in-depth research to augment and elaborate on your topic. We can conduct interviews with you and create an outline for your book based on your ideas that you can then refine and expand with your writer before the process begins.</p>

														<div class="entry-content">
															<p>The duration of the ghostwriting process is partly up to you—the author! Depending on your schedule and desired level of involvement, your ghostwriter will develop material for you to review and approve on a weekly or biweekly basis. While every book is unique, on average, a 200-page or 50,000-word manuscript will take between four and nine months to develop. We can often rush these services for you if you need to meet a specific publishing date.</p>

														<div class="entry-content">
															<p>The process of writing is a creative one that almost always morphs as it progresses. However, our professional writers are ready to work closely with you to ensure that the words on the page are as faithful to your vision as possible. Your writer will develop the material in small batches at a time, giving you and the ghostwriter ample opportunity to discuss and adjust the style, tone, and content of the writing. You’ll also have plenty of one-on-one interaction with your writer, which means that you’ll be able to come to a shared agreement about what you want your book to be.</p>

The fact is that some people are just too busy or lack the writing skills to develop a publishable book—but their voices still deserve to be heard. A ghostwriter facilitates this process and acts as a translator between your mind and what readers can understand and enjoy. The ghostwriting process is simply a means for getting your story into the world!</p>

If you are still unhappy with the writing after multiple revisions, we can assign a new writer to the project who is a better match for you—this type of flexibility is one of the unique benefits of working with a professional firm.</p>

															<p>We design our ghostwriting process to ensure that we’re always meeting your expectations and that there are no last-minute surprises. You will be able to review and influence your manuscript as the ghostwriter completes it, and you will have every opportunity to provide feedback and request revisions. Our process involves writing a small amount of material, sending it to you for feedback, making revisions based on your input, and then returning the revised content to you for approval before moving on. This method guarantees that you’ll be happy with the final result since you will have approved every page of writing leading up to the final page. With that said, if for some reason you’re not happy with the final product, it just means that it’s not the final product! We’ll continue to work with you until you’re satisfied with the results.</p>
