								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all of your writing and editing needs:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Is the price right?</b> If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.</li>
<li><b>Who owns the rights to the book?</b> It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.</li>
<li><b>What is the payment arrangement?</b> You should always pay for ghostwriting services in installments—never 100% upfront. After the initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your writer know what to expect.</li>
<li><b>Who’s in charge?</b> Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.</li>
<li><b>Is the service confidential?</b> This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed manuscript unless you want it to be there.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that you are working with a reputable company with experience.</p>

									<div class="icon"></div>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>The ghostwriting process can be as unique as you and your book! There are basic elements that are typically included in every book, however, our ghostwriting services are tailored to your specific needs and can include anything you need help with, from planning and preparation to ghostwriting to publishing.</p>
<p>We can work with you as consultants and editors as you develop your content on your own, or we can ghostwrite the book for you, based on interviews and other information you provide us.</p>
<p>In addition to information gathering via email and phone, a standard ghostwriting package includes writing, reviewing, and revising your content. We can also conduct in-person interviews, on-site visits, and independent research as needed. Our ghostwriting process is flexible, and we are happy to customize our service to best suit your personality, schedule, and publishing goals.</p>

									</div>
									<div class="icon"></div>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>The level of writing or editing services that you need depends on the strength and clarity of your content and the stage of development it is in.</p>
<p>If you have a well-written manuscript that just requires a final polish, copy editing is likely the best option for you.</p>
<p>Heavy editing is best for manuscripts that are early drafts or those that were either written quickly or by an inexperienced writer.</p>
<p>If you are looking for feedback on the development of your material, our critical review and analysis will provide you with in-depth input to help guide you through the writing process.</p>
<p>For more collaborative consultation, developmental editing services will give you dedicated support as you develop your ideas—or your manuscript-in-progress—into a coherent, comprehensible book.</p>
<p>If you need more extensive support with your content, we also offer rewriting and ghostwriting services that build off of existing material or generate new content.</p>
<p>Feel free to send us a sample of your work, and we’ll give you our professional opinion on which level of service will benefit your writing the most.</p>

While some may be reputable or qualified, most are overbooked and will not make good on the promises they make to you. Also, if anything should go wrong (whether it’s an issue between you and the writer, or a health concern), you will be stuck the awkward and frustrating position reclaiming your expenditures and then finding a replacement writer. With a firm like ours, we replace the writer free of charge to ensure the process moves forward efficiently and effectively.</li>
<li><b>What&#8217;s their reputation?</b> Be sure the writer or firm has worked on books that have been published by major publishing houses. Ideally, the writing service you choose will have a robust staff of bestselling writers, experienced editors, and a wide range of connections to literary agents and publishers.</li>

										<p>The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all your writing and editing needs:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Is the price right?</b> If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.</li>
<li><b>Who owns the rights to the book?</b> It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.</li>
<li><b>What is the payment arrangement?</b> You should always pay for ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your writer know what to expect.</li>
<li><b>Who’s in charge?</b> Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.</li>
<li><b>Is the service confidential?</b> This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed manuscript unless you want it to be there.</li>

This method guarantees that you’ll be happy with the final result since you will have approved every page of writing leading up to the final page. With that said, if for some reason you’re not happy with the final product, it just means that it’s not the final product! We’ll continue to work with you until you’re satisfied with the results.</p>

<li><b>What&#8217;s their reputation?</b> Be sure the writer or firm has worked on books that have been published by major publishing houses.

<p>Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that you are working with a reputable company with experience.b&gt; If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Who owns the rights to the book?</b> It’s your book, which means that you should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.</li>
<li><b>What is the payment arrangement?</b> You should always pay for ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your writer know what to expect.</li>
<li><b>Who’s in charge? </b>Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it’s not going to be your book—it will be theirs.</li>
<li><b>Is the service confidential?</b> This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s name should never appear on the completed manuscript unless you want it to be there.</li>

									</div>
									<div class="icon"></div>

								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>There are many similarities between memoirs and autobiographies—both are nonfiction, factual accounts based on the author’s life, written in the first person—but the biggest difference is the timeframe that is covered in each genre.</p>
<p>Simply put, an autobiography tells the entire story of the author’s life, while a memoir tells a specific story from parts of the author’s life. A memoir might address a particular period of time or phase of life that holds significance, or events that are all related in some way. An autobiography generally covers all aspects of the author’s life up to the time it is written, though some experiences may be given more or less emphasis to convey the desired theme or overarching message.</p>
<p>When choosing whether to write a memoir or an autobiography, consider whether you would like to write your life story, from the beginning to the present day, or whether you would like to focus in on a particular period of time.</p>

<li><b>Is the price right?</b> If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.</li>

									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all your writing and editing needs:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Is the price right?</b> If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate writers who market “affordable” prices.</li>
<li><b>Who owns the rights to the book?</b> It’s your book, which means you should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters asking for partial rights to your material.</li>
<li><b>What is the payment arrangement?</b> You should always pay for ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your writer know what to expect.</li>
<li><b>Who’s in charge?</b> Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it will not be your book—it will be theirs.</li>
<li><b>Should I choose a freelancer or a firm?</b> Beware of working with freelancers. While some may be reputable or qualified, most are overbooked and will not make good on the promises they make to you. Also, if anything should go wrong (whether it’s an issue between you and the writer, or a health concern), you will be stuck the awkward and frustrating position reclaiming your expenditures and then finding a replacement writer. With a firm like ours, we replace the writer free of charge to ensure the process moves forward efficiently and effectively.</li>
<li><b>What&#8217;s their reputation?</b> Be sure the writer or firm has worked on books that have been published by major publishing houses. Ideally, the writing service you choose will have a robust staff of bestselling writers, experienced editors, and a wide range of connections to literary agents and publishers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain that you are working with a reputable and experienced company.</p>

									</div>
									<div class="icon"></div>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>Different levels of editing are like differently sized sieves; they are each designed to catch various problems, ranging from minor errors to major content issues.</p>
<p><b>• Copy Editing and Proofreading</b><br />
This is the most basic form of editing and addresses only typos and objective grammatical errors. Only well-written manuscripts are ready for proofreading.</p>
<p><b>• Heavy editing</b><br />
For more in-depth review and revisions, heavy editing includes proofreading for grammar, as well as extensive revisions to improve diction, syntax, sentence structure, flow, style, tone, and transitions. Most manuscripts require heavy editing, though we can adjust our editing and pricing according to your manuscript’s condition.</p>
<p><b>• Critical review and analysis</b><br />
This service provides you with feedback and the opportunity to discuss your material with a writing expert. The editor will review and comment on your content and consult with you on how to best proceed with revisions and improvements.</p>
<p><b>• Developmental editing</b><br />
If you are looking for input on the creation of your content itself, developmental editing is a form of collaboration between author and editor in which the editor coaches the author through planning, writing, and revising their manuscript. Developmental editing addresses larger issues, such as the overarching themes and intention of the book, and includes broader suggestions and revisions to the structure, narrative, character development, voice, style, and pacing. It does not fully address spelling and grammar issues, as this is done significantly later in the process. Many first-time authors utilize a developmental editor to assist them throughout the writing process.</p>
<p><b>• Rewriting or ghostwriting</b><br />
Sometimes authors require help that goes beyond the scope of editing. In these cases, we offer options for rewriting or paraphrasing existing content, or ghostwriting original content. Our ghostwriting services can be utilized to develop an entire manuscript, or to add content and depth to an existing manuscript.</p>

									</div>
									<div class="icon"></div>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>The level of service that you need depends on the strength and clarity of your content, and the stage of development that it is in.</p>
<p>If you have a well-written manuscript that just requires final polishing, proofreading is likely the best option for you.</p>
<p>Heavy editing is best for manuscripts that are early drafts, or those that were written quickly or by an inexperienced writer.</p>
<p>If you are looking for feedback on the development of your material, critical review and analysis will provide you with in-depth input to help guide you in the writing process.</p>
<p>For more collaborative consultation, developmental editing services will give you dedicated support as you develop your ideas—or your manuscript-in-progress—into a coherent, comprehensible book.</p>
<p>If you need more extensive support with your content, we also offer rewriting and ghostwriting services to build off of existing material or generate new content.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>Your query letter is an invaluable marketing tool that you will use to promote your book to literary agents and publishers. Since publishers are constantly receiving countless manuscripts, literary agents act as a filtering system for the publishing industry. The endorsement of a literary agent gives publishers a level of assurance that your material is worth their time to review it.</p>
<p>Some writers’ circles say that you will need to query 80+ agents before you can justify calling it quits. Each query letter should be personalized to the recipient and address how you see your work complementing the roster of authors that the literary agent currently represents. The process is often long and taxing, and there is no guarantee that you’ll find representation. But, if you do, a literary agent will very likely be able to find a publisher for you and act as a champion for you and your book. Writing your query letter is the essential first step to obtaining a literary agent of your own.</p>

									</div>
									<div class="icon"></div>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>While there is no magic formula for the perfect query letter (in fact, the more personalized each letter is, the better), there are certain components that should generally be included.</p>
<p>First and foremost, a query letter is never longer than one page. Within that page, you must be sure to include a hook (a one- or two-line attention-grabbing statement that conveys the essence of your book), a brief bio that describes your credentials as an author, an explanation of why you think your book is a good fit for the agent or publisher, and last but not least, basic info about your book (such as the title, genre, and word count).</p>
<p>In addition to these specific elements, be sure to personalize, personalize, personalize! Have you attended a workshop with the literary agent or one of their associates? Have you studied one of their published authors? Did you hear the president of their company speak at a conference? Include anything you can that shows you’ve researched the agent or publisher, that you know their work, and that your book would be a good fit within their existing markets and business model.</p>
<p>A book proposal is quite similar to a query letter, except that it is longer and generally includes a synopsis or outline of the book, chapter summaries, detailed author bio, marketing platform/strategy, and a market analysis. Book proposals are generally used for nonfiction books and can be submitted for a manuscript that is not yet complete.</p>
<p>In general, authors of fiction and memoir/autobiography will submit a query letter and authors of nonfiction will submit book proposals.</p>

										<p>Significant sections of your query letter can be sent to more than one agent or publisher; however, query letters are most effective when they are customized to your recipient.

									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>Unless you’ve been specifically requested or directed to do so, don’t send your entire manuscript with your query letter! This is a classic pet peeve for agents and publishers and, more often than not, your unsolicited manuscript will end up in the recycling bin. Instead, be sure that your query letter or book proposal is attention grabbing and contains all of the necessary information about you and your book. Each agent will have specific submission requirements, which typically include a small writing sample from your book. If they like what they see, they’ll ask you to submit the entire manuscript for review.</p>
