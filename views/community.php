														<h5>We believe that every word has its own useful meaning and impact on one’s life and society in general. As a result, we believe in the power of the written word and have had the opportunity to witness it firsthand.</h5>
<h5>The desire to share ideas is at the heart of our industry. The driving motivation for authors has always been the same, from ancient hands carving cuneiform on clay tablets to modern bloggers: the preservation and spread of treasured narratives, perspectives, and voices.</h5>
<h5>Printing a book is, at its core, an act of giving—an attempt at human connection. Above all, publishing is about bringing people together. We take pride in being an active member of the global community of readers and writers, as well as in supporting literacy initiatives and other related causes that help foster positive relationships and improve the world.</h5>
<h5>Here are a few of our current initiatives; however, we are always looking for new ways to give back to our community. Please contact us if you want to invite UA to join a cause that you care about.</h5>

<h3>Bettirose and Make-A-Wish</h3>
<p>We are thrilled to be collaborating with Make-A-Wish® Metro New York and cancer survivor Bettirose Epstein to help her write and publish her YA fantasy novel. Bettirose's real-life battle with cancer inspired the story, themes, characters, and magical setting of the book. In the next few months, we’ll be securing an agent and publisher for Bettirose, and helping her launch her book!</p>
<p>Bettirose was medically eligible for a Wish after being diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of 13. Make-a-Wish approached Updike Associates in early 2019 to assist with the author's dream of becoming a published author. We, of course, said yes and have been overseeing the entire process at no cost to Bettirose or Make-a-Wish. Bettirose's dream of becoming a published author is about to come true, despite the challenges of her recovery, homework, friends, and now COVID19.</p>
<p>Bettirose has collaborated with bestselling ghostwriter Julia Watts, as well as our team of editors and publishing consultants. We'll be collaborating with industry-leading book marketers, PR agents, and literary agents to ensure Bettirose's book is a success, as well as nurturing her throughout the book-writing process.We are glad to help her through this.</p>
<p>In the next few months, we’ll be securing an agent and publisher for Bettirose, and helping her launch her book!</p>

<h3>Call for Manuscripts: Underrepresented Voices</h3>
<p>Publishing, like most industries, has profited from and often exploited, marginalized groups in our society. Our industry has ignored, slighted, or otherwise silenced far too many dynamic voices. Updike Associates hopes to make a small contribution to redressing this injustice.</p>
<p>In that vein, we encourage and are currently accepting manuscript submissions from marginalized voices, particularly people of color. We accept both fiction and nonfiction manuscripts, but the subject of each project should address (directly or indirectly) issues of race, equality, social justice, representation, economic injustice, and other issues that promote equality.</p>
<p>In this process, each submission will be reviewed by our team, and a winner will be chosen based on the work's artistic merit and potential for change.</p>
<p>The winning manuscript will receive a full suite of services pro bono:<br />
&#8211; EDITING: Manuscript review and analysis by one of our Executive Editors<br />
&#8211; REVISIONS: Several rounds of revisions and review<br />
&#8211; PITCH MATERIALS: Writing/editing query letter and pitch materials<br />
&#8211; SECURING A PUBLISHING DEAL: Leveraging our connections to secure a traditional publishing deal (there will be no agent’s commission)</p>
<h4>SUBMISSION WINDOW</h4>
<p>Now through August 1st, 2021</p>
<h4>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
<p>Please include the following materials with your submission:</p>
<p>&#8211; Author Bio: Tell us a little bit about yourself and why you're the right author for this book.<br />
&#8211; Query Letter: Tell us about your book in 300 words or less.<br />
&#8211; Writing Sample: Submit at least the first three chapters (feel free to send the entire manuscript)</p>
<p>Send all submissions to <a href="mailto:submissions@updikeassociates.com">submissions@updikeassociates.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Kravis Children’s Hospital and Child Life and Creative Arts Therapy Department</h3>
<p>Several members of Updike Associates' management team, as well as acclaimed children's author and UA ghostwriter Elizabeth Cody Kimmel, spent an afternoon at Mount Sinai's Kravis Children's Hospital. The event included book giveaways, readings, and signings as part of a collaboration with the Child Life and Creative Arts Therapy Department.</p>

<h3>Reach Out and Read</h3>
<p>We were overjoyed to be able to contribute 250 books to this wonderful organization. Reach Out and Read is a non-profit organization dedicated to assisting families in developing daily reading routines and engaging in other language-rich activities. Their pediatric teams incorporate reading into their practices and provide parents with the tools and knowledge they need to encourage these habits. Reading aloud, when incorporated into a daily routine, promotes healthy brain development, advances language acquisition, and assists families in developing meaningful bonds.</p>
