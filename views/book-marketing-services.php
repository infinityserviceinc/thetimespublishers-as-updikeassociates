											Which Is Better Suited for Me?</p>
									</div>
									<div class="icon"></div>
								</div>
								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>There are many similarities between memoirs and autobiographies—both are
											nonfiction, factual accounts based on the author’s life, written in the
											first person—but the biggest difference is the timeframe that is covered in
											each genre.</p>
										<p>Simply put, an autobiography tells the entire story of the author’s life,
											while a memoir tells a specific story from parts of the author’s life. A
											memoir might address a particular period of time or phase of life that holds
											significance, or events that are all related in some way. An autobiography
											generally covers all aspects of the author’s life up to the time it is
											written, though some experiences may be given more or less emphasis to
											convey the desired theme or overarching message.</p>
										<p>When choosing whether to write a memoir or an autobiography, consider whether
											you would like to write your life story, from the beginning to the present
											day, or whether you would like to focus in on a particular period of time.

									</div>

								</div>
								<div class="body-content body">
									<div class="entry-content">
										<p>The internet is littered with online writing and editing services, making it
											nearly impossible to sift through the scams and find a legitimate and
											trustworthy service. Here are some questions to ask when you’re vetting
											companies to ensure that you pick a reliable firm for all your writing and
											editing needs:</p>
										<ol>
											<li><b>Is the price right?</b> If it seems too good to be true, it probably
												is. Developing a high-quality book can take hundreds of hours of work
												and requires a high level of expertise—don’t be tempted by third-rate
												writers who market “affordable” prices.</li>
											<li><b>Who owns the rights to the book?</b> It’s your book, which means that
												you should own the rights to your content. Be wary of ghostwriters
												asking for partial rights to your material.</li>
											<li><b>What is the payment arrangement?</b> You should always pay for
												ghostwriting services in installments and never 100% upfront. After the
												initial deposit, you should make subsequent payments only if you’re
												happy with what the ghostwriter has written up to that point. You should
												have clearly defined milestones for payments to ensure that you and your
												writer know what to expect.</li>
											<li><b>Who’s in charge?</b> Working with a ghostwriter is a collaborative
												effort, but you should have the final say on all content decisions. If a
												writer is unwilling to put your needs and requests first, then it’s not
												going to be your book—it will be theirs.</li>
											<li><b>Is the service confidential?</b> This is YOUR book. A ghostwriter’s
												name should never appear on the completed manuscript unless you want it
												to be there.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>Whatever service you decide to use, be sure to protect yourself. Make certain
											that you are working with a reputable company with experience.</p>
